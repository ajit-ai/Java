###Java

Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language used to build web apps, mobile applications, and enterprise software systems. It is known for its Write Once, Run Anywhere capability, which means code written in Java can run on any device that supports the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).


Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It is platform-independent, which means we can write code once and run it anywhere using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java is mostly used for building desktop applications, web applications, Android apps, and enterprise systems.

Key Features of Java
Platform Independent: Java is famous for its Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA) feature. This means we can write our Java code once, and it will run on any device or operating system without changing anything.
Simple: Java syntax is very straightforward and very easy to learn. Java removes complex features like pointers and multiple inheritance, which makes it a good choice for beginners.
Object-Oriented: Java follows the object-oriented programming. This makes code clean and reusable.
Secured: Java does not support pointers, it includes built-in protections to keep our programs secure from common problems like memory leakage.
Multithreading: Java programs can do many things at the same time using multiple threads. This is useful for handling complex tasks like processing transactions.
Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler: Java uses a JIT compiler. It improves performance by converting the bytecode into machine readable code at the time of execution.
